### Q1: If the color is based on population, why are all counties shown in the same color?
* Here United States population is exceptionally way more higher than any other countries, so all counties are shown in same color. @rchinta

### Q2: Are all of the counties the same color now? Why did this change things?
* No, counties with different population intensity has been populated with different color intesity. This is because we removed the AK,HI,PR and Visualizing for all countikes in USA. @ysurapneni

### Q3: What is the county with the highest population? What is its population? Does this make sense?
* Los Angels conty, 10170292, Yes it does make sense from the Visualization. @rvajrapu
	
### Q4: Name 2 other high population counties. Do these make sense?
* Cook County, Harris County, Yes it does make sense from the Visualization. @rchinta

### Q5: Why were State and State already automatically linked and the others weren't?
* The data enties represent the same column name but others were not. @ysurapneni

### Q6: Compare this map with the Population map. Are they different? Why or why not?
* Yes, they look same visually since population is still the measuring index for color coding. But when we hover over each area code, we see additional values for Sheet 2. @rvajrapu

### Q7: Compare this map with the Population map. Are they different? Why or why not?
* Yes, they are different as Population map visually indicates population intensity whereas this map indicates Bachelor's degree holders percentage of distribution in each county. @rchinta

### Q8: Compare this map with the Num w/Bachelor's map. Which map gives a better picture of the education level in the county? Why?
* Num w/Bachelor's map visualizes a count wheras this visualizes % of Bachelors over population. Percentage of Education Level gives the accurate level of education compared to total population in a county. @ysurapneni

### Q9: What did you observe about the different color maps? Which ones were most useful in highlighting extremes?
* Choosing a dark color such as #0d0df9 with higher opacity is visually helpful to identify extremes. @rvajrapu
